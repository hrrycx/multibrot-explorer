# multibrot-explorer
rust egui project to explore multibrot fractals

## notes (maybe put these in the program as like a comment thing): 
- keep maxitr generally in range 300-1500
- higher exponents need a lower maxitr (which helps to keep frame times down)

## todo:
- change colour of fps dependent on colour of fractal
- show orbits
- right click to set center
- pi approximation
- allow negative powers
- more colouring algorithms (and hue range)
- reset button
- add option to show axes
- better styling
- format readme
- make code easier to read, main is awful

## running
run with `cargo run --release` for best performance
