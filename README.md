# multibrot-explorer
rust egui project to explore multibrot fractals

## notes (maybe put these in the program as like a comment thing): 
- keep maxitr generally in range 300-1500
- higher exponents need a lower maxitr (which helps to keep frame times down)

## todo:
- allow negative powers
- more colouring algorithms
- add option to show axes
- better styling
- format readme
